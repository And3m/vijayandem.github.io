Hello, World!
Hi, I am Shivesh Tiwari, a 20 year old developer based in India. I love to build software and am passionate about building high performance software.

I specialize in full-stack development across both mobile and web, with deep expertise in frameworks and technologies like React, React Native, TypeScript, Node.js, Supabase, and Rust. From crafting seamless user experiences to designing optimized backends, I enjoy turning ideas into production-ready products.

Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked on projects ranging from AI-powered platforms and mobile apps to developer tools and open-source projects, always with a focus on performance, usability, and innovation.

Let's connect and look for future collaborations!
